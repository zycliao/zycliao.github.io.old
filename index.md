Hi there. My name is Zhouyingcheng Liao (廖周应成). You can just call me Zhou. I am a Master student in Computer Science at Saarland University and Max Planck Institute for Informatics, supervised by Prof [Gerard Pons-Moll](virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de). 

In 2020, I obtained the Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Also in 2020, I interned at the best anime games company in China, miHoYo, working with Dr [Jun Xing](https://junxnui.github.io/).  

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics. More specifically, I am interested in modelling and animating digital characters driven by AI. My research goal is to develop algorithms that can free content creators from hard labours.
