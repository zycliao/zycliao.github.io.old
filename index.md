Hi there. My name is Zhouyingcheng Liao (廖周应成). I am a Master student in Computer Science at Saarland University and Max Planck Institute for Informatics, supervised by Dr. [Marc Harbermann](https://gvdh.mpi-inf.mpg.de/index.html). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I interned at Adobe Research in 2021. Before that, I interned at miHoYo in Shanghai, working with Dr. [Jun Xing](https://junxnui.github.io/). I worked as a Research Assitant at MPI-INF under the supervision of Prof. [Gerard Pons-Moll](virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de).

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics. More specifically, I am interested in modelling and animating digital characters driven by AI. My research goal is to develop algorithms that can free content creators from hard labours.
